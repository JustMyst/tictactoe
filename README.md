# tictactoe
TicTacToe game in Xamarin with Single' and Multi-player, Options, AI levels and stats.
It's actually TikTakTo≈Ç - that's how I'd write pronunciation in Polish language.. As I'm Polish.

Game has not been tested on iOS since i don't have acces to it.

Surely works on Android, however AI on hardest level may not do his move at some time.

Game has options in which you can choose:
- If you want to play with friend or with AI
- who will start - PLAYER ONE IS "O", AI is "X"
- Level of AI
All Stats are saved to AppProperties.
